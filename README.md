# 🎳⚽🦖🥊🎿 משחקי הטוש (The Marker Games)

Five games designed by kids, drawn with markers, and brought to life. Every
game is a page of the same little kit: cel-shaded "marker on paper" rendering, one
keyboard or a touch pad, one or two players, and a headless test that drives it.

| Game | Page | The kid's rule |
|---|---|---|
| 🎳 **כדור באולינג בורח** (Bowling Escape) | `/` | The world only moves when the ball moves. Every strike is worth ten, and the crowd of monsters keeps growing the longer you roll. |
| ⚽ **פנדלים בנגיחה** (Header Penalties) | `/pendel.html` | Read the keeper's lean, head the lob into the corner he isn't. Five kicks a round; two players can take turns as keeper. |
| 🦖 **דינו במבוך** (Dino Maze) | `/dino.html` | Eat fifteen little dinos in an endless maze, dodge the dragon's flame, find the exit before the dragons get angry. |
| 🥊 **משחק אגרופים** (Punch Game) | `/punch.html` | Stretch-punch the whole forest, dash out of trouble, survive wave after wave. A second cat can join. |
| 🎿 **כלב גולש** (Kelpie Downhill) | `/ski.html` | Our real dog, as a 3D model, skis an endless slope: thread the gates, grab the bones, launch off kickers and spin. Three bones, no lift ticket. |

The drawings the games were built from are in [`drawings/`](drawings/README.md); the
one-page design sheets ("verb sheets") are in [`design/`](design/README.md).

## Run it

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

`npm run build` builds all pages into `dist/`. `npm run build:artifacts` builds each game
as a single self-contained HTML fragment in `artifacts/`, ready to publish (cross-links
then point at the published artifact URLs in `games.json`). `npm test` runs the headless
balance checks in Chrome.

## Controls

- **One player:** arrows or WASD to move · **Space** = the action (shoot / head / punch) ·
  **Shift** = dash (punch game) · Enter or Space starts and restarts.
- **Two players** (penalties, punch): player 1 = arrows + Enter + right Shift, player 2 =
  WASD + Space + left Shift.
- **Touch:** drag on the left half of the screen to move, tap the buttons on the right.
- 🔊 in the corner mutes everything, and remembers.

## How it's built

- `games.json` — the one list of games: page, title, colour, published artifact URL. The
  Vite config, the "more games" links on every intro card and the artifact build all read
  it, so adding a game touches one file plus its own page and source.
- `src/kit/` — the shared engine:
  - `app.js` renderer, scene, lights, marker outlines (three's `OutlineEffect`) and the
    frame loop; `?sim` in the URL stops the loop so tests can step it by hand
  - `toon.js` cached cel materials, per-material outline tints, blob shadows, hull
    outlines for instanced props, hand-drawn textures, wobble
  - `input.js` one- or two-player keyboard maps, edge-triggered actions, touch pad
  - `hud.js` badges, the centre flash, overlays, manifest links, best scores, mute
  - `audio.js` beeps, noise bursts, a master mute and a tiny generative music box
  - `juice.js` hitstop, camera shake, floating score numbers, squash-and-stretch
- `src/characters/` — the punch game's fighters, each built from its drawing.
- `src/main.js`, `pendel.js`, `dino.js`, `punch.js` — one file per game.
- `src/ski.js` — the ski game; Babylon.js (`@babylonjs/core`) instead of three.js because the dog
  model (`src/assets/dog.glb`, see `design/ski.md`) was exported for Babylon, but it uses the kit's
  HUD, input, audio and `?sim` hook like every other page.
- `tests/` — Playwright specs that load each page with `?sim`, drive
  `window.__<game>.step(dt)` and assert the balance rules from the design sheets.

## Publish flow

`npm run build:artifacts -- <id>` writes `artifacts/<id>.html`; publish it with the
Artifact tool using the `artifact` URL from `games.json` to keep the same link.
